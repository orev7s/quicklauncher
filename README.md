## Keyboard Shortcuts

QuickLauncher supports the following modifier keys:
- `Ctrl` (Control)
- `Alt` (Alternate)
- `Shift`

You must use **at least one modifier key** combined with a regular key (e.g., `Ctrl+Alt+A`).

### Hotkey Examples
- `Ctrl+Alt+D` - Launch development apps
- `Ctrl+Shift+G` - Launch games
- `Alt+Shift+W` - Launch work applications
- `Ctrl+Alt+1` - Quick launch set 1

## Advanced Features

### Command-Line Arguments

Launch applications with specific parameters:
- Chrome with a specific profile: `--profile-directory="Profile 1"`
- Games in fullscreen: `--fullscreen` or `-windowed`
- Custom config files: `/config=myconfig.ini`

### Run as Administrator

Some applications require elevated privileges. Enable "Run as Administrator" for:
- System utilities
- Applications that modify system settings
- Development tools requiring elevated access

**Note**: You'll see a UAC prompt each time these apps are launched.

### Launch Delay

When launching multiple apps, add a delay to prevent:
- System resource overload
- Apps competing for initialization
- Database connection conflicts

Recommended delays:
- Light apps (browsers, editors): 100-500ms
- Heavy apps (IDEs, databases): 1000-2000ms

### Import/Export Shortcuts

**Export**: Save your shortcuts configuration to share with team members or backup
1. Click "Export..."
2. Choose location and filename
3. Share the JSON file

**Import**: Load shortcuts from a file
1. Click "Import..."
2. Select the JSON file
3. Confirm to replace current shortcuts

### Hotkey Conflict Detection

QuickLauncher automatically detects when you try to use a hotkey that's already assigned to another shortcut. You'll be warned and can choose to:
- Use a different hotkey
- Override the existing shortcut (the old one will stop working)

## Configuration

Settings are automatically saved to:
```
%APPDATA%\QuickLauncher\settings.json
```

The configuration file contains:
- Application shortcuts and their hotkeys
- Startup preferences
- Window settings

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: .NET 6.0 (Windows Forms)
- **Language**: C#
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Newtonsoft.Json (13.0.3)

## Troubleshooting

### Hotkey doesn't work
- Ensure the hotkey isn't already in use by another application
- Try using a different key combination
- Restart QuickLauncher after making changes

### Application won't start
